# WIKI Walking Tours

### Summary

This application allows a user to explore historical or other wiki-worthwhile locations in a new city. Wiki Walking Tours is not intended for fans of guided tours, rather, we equip the user to become their own tour-guide. Go at it at your own pace or in your own direction. Most importantly, have fun!
